            <h2>Vision of Trail Life</h2>
            <p>More than ever, boys need a uniquely masculine program where their assertive, audacious, and adventurous nature is celebrated, not sequestered.</p>
            <h3>Let Boys Be Boys</h3>
            <p>Too many boys are turning to virtual worlds of television, video games, digital media, and the internet to find realms they can conquer and areas where they can excel. The result of this virtual conquest is often apathy, apparent rebellion, or outright resistance to real-world challenge.</p>
            <p>Trail Life USA is an environment where boys thrive! Adults are equipped to lead a program in a structured outdoor environment where boys are engaged in real-world challenge and experience camping, hiking, and fishing; they develop skills in riflery, archery, and canoeing; and learn character and leadership in a practical hands-on manner that is naturally engaging.</p>
            <p>In the outdoors, the experience of adults is never obsolete; boys find mentors, fathers and sons connect, important relationships are fostered, and boys find opportunity to achieve significant accomplishment.</p>

            <h2>Program Overview</h2>
            <article id="woodlands">
                <h3>Woodlands (K-5th grade)</h3>
                <img src="woodlands-img1.jpg" alt="Woodlands TrailMen in action" width="300">
                <p><strong>Fox Patrol</strong> (5- & 6-year-olds - must be 5 years old by 10/31/24)</p>
                <p>We do require a parent to accompany their Fox TrailMan at all meetings & events.</p>
                <p><strong>Hawk Patrol</strong> (7- & 8-year-olds)</p>
                <p><strong>Mountain Lion Patrol</strong> (9- & 10-year-olds)</p>
                <p>Boys on the Woodlands Trail (age 5-10) gain knowledge about outdoor skills, citizenship, character, friendship, and faith through fun activities, awards, and skill instruction. The Woodlands Trail covers 7 'Branches' of learning: Heritage, Hobbies, Life Skills, Outdoor Skills, Science & Technology, Sports & Fitness, and Values. Each Branch consists of 3-5 'steps' that are covered at Troop Meetings. Each Branch will have a corresponding 'Hit the Trail (HTT),' a field trip outside of our normal Troop meeting that allows the boys to experience a new adventure. Campouts, Elgin Public Museum, local Fire House tours, sleepover on a submarine or MSI are just some of the examples of past HTTs. TrailMen can make up for missed meetings or missed HTTs by completing Family Home Activities (FHAs). The TrailMan Handbook lists out the corresponding FHAs for each Patrol and Branch. TrailMan can earn the Worthy Life Award by participating in their Patrol's Bible Study and completing the appropriate spiritual disciplines like Bible memory.</p>

                <h3>Navigators (6th-8th grade)</h3>
                <img src="navigators-img1.jpg" alt="Navigators earning Trail Badges" width="300">
                <p>As Navigators, boys age 11-13 gain understanding of their values and beliefs under the guidance of godly male role models through being responsible in outdoor adventures and in their home and school life. They explore areas of interest and earn Trail Badges for advancement. Skills universally needed for godly manhood are developed through required Trail Badges; Aquatics, Camping, Fire Ranger, First Aid, Our Flag, Outdoor Cooking, Ropework, Trail Skills, and Wood Tools. Elective Trail Badges help a TrailMan explore unique areas of gifting and come to understand the way God has specially created him.</p>

            <article id="adventurers">
                <h3>Adventurers (9th-12th grade)</h3>
                <img src="adventurers-img1.jpg" alt="Adventurers leading activities" width="300">
                <p>As Adventurers, young men ages 14-18 mature in wisdom and faith through more difficult challenges and leadership activities with Christian men walking alongside. They plan and lead outdoor events and large projects while exercising leadership positions in the Troop, even mentoring some of the younger TrailMen. Adventurers are challenged with more advanced required Trail Badges; Citizenship, Emergency Preparedness, FamilyMan, Fitness, Outdoor Life, & Personal Resources.</p>
